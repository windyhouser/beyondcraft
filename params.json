The mods will give you 2 warning if you're online. *Permanent Ban* if you steal three times or at mod's discretion.\r\n1. Be polite. I know this sounds silly, but sometimes you might need to say please. Even if you don't curse, that doesn't mean you can't be rude. Temporary Ban if you're rude.\r\n1. No pretending to be a mod. The admin knows all the mods personally, so they will know if you do. *Permanent Ban*\r\n1. NO derogatory terms. No saying things like \"Girls are stupid.\" Or \"Gay people suck.\" You will be banned. We are accepting of all here. That doesn't mean you can't have personal opinions, but please keep them to yourself.\r\n1. No advocating products. This server's only purpose is to provide enjoyment. NOT to tell people about your server.\r\n1. No behaving inappropriately. You can never know who is really at the computer. Just because the person's skin is female, doesn't mean they are. Be smart.\r\n\r\nPlease report all rule breakers. Thank you, for being a considerate BeyondCraft Citizen. \r\n\r\n### Want to chat? Join our hangout!\r\nWe chat on the BeyondCraft hangout.
